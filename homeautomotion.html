    <div class="section"><h2>1. Introduction</h2><p>In an era driven by automation and connectivity, smart homes are no longer a futuristic luxury but a modern necessity. However, most advanced home automation systems remain costly, complex, or inaccessible to a large segment of society, especially in developing countries. Recognizing this gap, we developed Advance Home Automation, a locally designed and implemented system in Bangladesh, offering affordable and accessible smart control over key electrical appliances.
        This system enables automatic control of home electronics via alarms and schedules, offering both Wi-Fi and offline Bluetooth access, alongside NFC-triggered night mode and support for universal remote controllers. The device is currently installed in multiple residential setups and has demonstrated excellent performance in daily use.
        </p></div>
    <div class="section"><h2>2. Problem Statement</h2><p>Despite the availability of smart home technologies, most systems are:</p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Dependent on continuous internet</li><li>Limited in control range</li><li>Difficult to install or integrate</li></ul></div>
    <div class="section"><h2>3. Objectives</h2><ul><li>To develop a cost-effective and compact smart controller.</li><li>To ensure remote and offline control (via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).</li>
    <li>To automate essential household utilities: light, fan, water pump, lift, regulator, generator.</li>
    <li>To support custom alarms and schedules for automation.</li>
    <li>To provide an NFC-based night mode activation.</li>
    <li>To allow control via TV/AC remotes, increasing user flexibility.</li>
    <li> To integrate with a custom mobile application (under development).</li>
    
    </ul></div>
    <div class="section"><h2>4. Literature Review</h2><p>SmartThings offer extensive automation capabilities. However, these systems:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>
            Are priced at a premium.

        <li>Require cloud connectivity.</li>
    <li>Often do not support offline operation.</li>
    <li>May not be compatible with local infrastructure in Bangladesh.</li>
    <p> Studies on IoT-based smart homes ([1], [2]) emphasize the importance of local control, data privacy, and cost-effective implementation. Our work builds upon these principles, providing a practical alternative specifically designed for Bangladeshi users.</p>
    </ul>
