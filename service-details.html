        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bangladesh is facing an increasing crisis of fire events, mainly gas leaks, caused by the poor. Infrastructure and inadequate safety measures. Bangladeshs fire Service, more than 24,000 fire events were reported alone in 2019, resulting in important Loss of life and property. 2024 Bailey Road Fire in Dhaka, which started because of a gas Leaked at a restaurant, highlighted weaknesses in current security systems. Traditional fire Security measures, such as fire extinguisher and alarms, are often insufficient Prevents disasters, especially in buildings and poorly maintained.</p>
        <p>It presents paper holes (gas and fire shields), which is an innovative tool designed Solve these challenges. Interval is a compact, automatic system that detects gas leaks And fire hazards, Immediate Measures to reduce the risk and warn of relevant officers. By integrating multiple security facilities into the same device, the target of the gap is to revolutionize Bangladesh and beyond fire protection.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Gas leaks: LPG and natural gas are widely used in homes and businesses, But leaks are common due to poor maintenance and substandard equipment.</li>
          <li>Electrical defects: Overloaded cycle and defective wires often shoot.</li>
          <li>Lack of security measures: Many buildings lack alarm, emergency exit and Gas closure system.</li>
          <li>Overfilled places: The risk of high population density increases in urban areas Casication during the fire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bailey Road Fire from 2024 is a tragic example of these problems. The fire spread quickly Due to the absence of gas leakage, flammable materials and emergency systems. it Underline an active, automatic solution requirement to prevent phenomenon Disasters.</p>

        <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Unique Features of Holes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No power dependence:</strong> Operates on battery and solar. Works without direct power connection.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget installation:</strong> Approx. 10,000 BDT, modular setup based on area size.</li>
          <li><strong>Fully automatic operation:</strong> Detects threats and activates response within 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency message:</strong> Sends SMS with GPS location using GSM network.</li>
          <li><strong>Extensive mitigation:</strong> Activates alarm, shuts gas, powers sprinklers, and emergency lighting.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>3.2. System Workflow (Updated with Power Depiction)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Track: Smoke and gas sensors send data to the control unit.</li>
          <li>Response: Activates alarms, lights, gas shutoff, and sprinklers.</li>
          <li>Emergency alert: Sends SMS to user and nearest fire station with GPS.</li>
          <li>Guidance: Illuminates escape routes and triggers alarms for safety.</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h3>3.3. Interval Application</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Residential:</strong> Works during power failure, protects from kitchen fires.</li>
          <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> Prevents gas fires, low-cost and easy to install.</li>
          <li><strong>Industries:</strong> Monitors large areas, scalable design.</li>
          <li><strong>Offices:</strong> Safe for employees, reliable in unstable electricity zones.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>3.4. Testing and Verification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Battery/solar powered for 72+ hours.</li>
          <li>Main unit ~10,000 BDT. Users found setup satisfactory.</li>
          <li>Responds in under 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>SMS and GPS alerts work without internet.</li>
          <li>GSM and GPS based system.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Result</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No power addiction: Works on rechargeable batteries and solar.</li>
          <li>Cost-effective: Modular and scalable pricing.</li>
          <li>Rapid response: 30-second automatic activation.</li>
          <li>Reliable alerts: Offline SMS/GPS system.</li>
          <li>User satisfaction: Strong feedback on reliability and automation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Discussion</h2>
        <p>Unique features of intervals—as their power dependence, not compatible with the budget Establishment, and fully automated operating—make a game chain in fire and gas Security. These features face important challenges in Bangladesh, such as unstable Power supply, high costs for traditional safety systems and delay Reactions. However, there should be challenges such as public awareness and maintenance It was addressed to ensure widespread adoption.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The gap represents a significant jump in fire and gass safety technology. By Battery and solar, GSM technology and automated control, and utilize it Offers a comprehensive solution for homes, restaurants, industries and public places. With its reasonable price and modular design, the ability to save lives in intervals can And prevent large-scale damage to property.</p>
        <p>Future research should focus on increasing production, raising awareness and To integrate intervals into national security standards. With proper support, can interval Bangladesh changes fire safety and works as a model for other countries Similar challenges.</p>
